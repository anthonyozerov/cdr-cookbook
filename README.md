# cdr-cookbook
A cookbook for clustering and dimension-reduction.

## What is this?
This text is intended as a quick reference on various methods in dimension-reduction and clustering, **not** as an introduction to the subject, or a guide on how to do anything. This text was born out of a lack of a quick reference for clustering and dimension-reduction methods.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to this text! It is definitely a work in progress.

## Building
Just use `latexmk -pdf cdr-cookbook.tex`. You can also clean the directory a little by running `latexmk -c`.
